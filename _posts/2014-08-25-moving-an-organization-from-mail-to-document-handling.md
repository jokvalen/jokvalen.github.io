This was both a challenge in culture, and finding the right tools for improving internal communication and the prioritisations of our projects.

The circle of lost time: time lost on continuously working in the way of old habits, leaving no time to look into new ways of working smarter and faster.

We approached this by gradually introducing friendly users into the programs, adjusting the systems to our organization structure and by introducing a workflow that fitted users and developers simultaneously. Lots of hours spent discussing use cases for different apartments and «selling in» the solution to the friendly users. «This can be done like this instead», finding the middle way between dev and user language.
